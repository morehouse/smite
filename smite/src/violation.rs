//! Target-misbehavior findings.
//!
//! Each [`Violation`] variant names a buggy target behavior (e.g., crashing,
//! hanging, breaking a protocol invariant). This is how the fuzzer reports bugs
//! in the target.
//!
//! Conditions that are *not* the target's fault should be ordinary errors and
//! never a `Violation` (e.g., transport failures, insufficient wallet funds,
//! mutator-produced invalid commitments, undecodable harness input).
