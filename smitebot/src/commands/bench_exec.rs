//! Single-input Nyx benchmark.
//!
//! Boots the target's Nyx VM and runs one fixed input through it a fixed number
//! of times, measuring steady-state throughput and per-execution latency.
//! Because each execution is a snapshot restore plus one target run, the numbers
//! isolate VM/snapshot and target speed from AFL++'s mutation and scheduling
//! overhead.
//!
//! Like `start`, `bench-exec` builds the Docker image and sets up the Nyx
//! sharedir before running. Pass `--no-build` to skip that and reuse an
//! already-prepared sharedir (e.g. from a prior `start`, `bench-exec`, or
//! `scripts/setup-nyx.sh`).
